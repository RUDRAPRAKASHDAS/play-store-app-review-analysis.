Because of these two factors, more and more apps are being developed. In this notebook, we will do a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. We'll look for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.\n",

        "2. Data Cleaning: Data cleaning refers to the process of removing unwanted variables and values from your dataset and getting rid of any irregularities in it. Such anomalies can disproportionately skew the data and hence adversely affect the results. Some steps that can be done to clean data are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Removing missing values, outliers, and unnecessary rows/ columns.\n",
        "Re-indexing and reformatting our data.\n",
        "3. Univariate Analysis: In Univariate Analysis, you analyze data of just one variable. A variable in your dataset refers to a single feature/ column. You can do this either with graphical or non-graphical means by finding specific mathematical values in the data. Some visual methods include:\n",
        "\n",
        "Histograms: Bar plots in which the frequency of data is represented with rectangle bars.\n",
        "\n",
        "Box-plots: Here the information is represented in the form of boxes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Bivariate Analysis: Here, you use two variables and compare them. This way, you can find how one feature affects the other. It is done with scatter plots, which plot individual data points or correlation matrices that plot the correlation in hues. You can also use boxplots.\n",
